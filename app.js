//DOM stuff to get form values

// click add book button
// triggers form opening
// user fills form with data
// data is loaded from form to js
// data is used to make a book object
// book object is rendered into the shelf div
// shelf div renders each object as a card
// method should not re-render already rendered books
// use id to know what books have already been rendered
// book cards should have two buttons: delete and read
// delete button should delete the card and the actual book from storage (array)
// read button should toggle between read and unread status
